Child Process
process created by another process called the parent process. The child process runs concurrently with the parent process and is created using a fork system call or a spawn system call. The child process has a unique process ID (PID) and can execute different code than the parent process. Once created, the child process can run independently of the parent process or communicate with it using inter-process communication mechanisms such as pipes, sockets, or shared memory. Child processes are often used in multiprocessing applications and can be used to execute tasks in parallel, offloading work from the main process.
