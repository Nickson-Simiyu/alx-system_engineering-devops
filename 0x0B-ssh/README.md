SSH Connection Task Introduction This task is designed to help you connect to a remote server using the SSH protocol. SSH allows you to securely log in to a remote system over a network, and is commonly used by system administrators, developers, and other IT professionals.

Prerequisites Before starting this task, you should have the following:

A remote server that you want to connect to The IP address or hostname of the remote server The SSH private key that you will use for authentication The username that you will use to log in to the remote server (if different from the default) Instructions To connect to the remote server using SSH, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt on your local computer. Navigate to the directory where your SSH private key is stored. This is typically in the ~/.ssh directory on Unix-like systems, or in the C:\Users<username>.ssh directory on Windows systems. Use the ssh command to connect to the remote server. The basic syntax is as follows: php Copy code ssh -i <private_key_file> @<server_address> Replace <private_key_file> with the path to your SSH private key file, with the username you want to use to log in to the remote server (if different from the default), and <server_address> with the IP address or hostname of the remote server.

If this is the first time you are connecting to the remote server, you may see a message asking if you want to add the server to your list of known hosts. Type yes to add the server to your list of known hosts.

If your private key is protected by a passphrase, you will be prompted to enter it. Enter your passphrase and press Enter.

If everything is set up correctly, you should now be logged in to the remote server's command line interface. You can now execute commands on the remote server just as if you were logged in to the local computer.

Conclusion SSH is a powerful tool that allows you to securely connect to and manage remote systems over a network. By following the instructions in this task, you should now be able to connect to a remote server using SSH and begin working with it. If you have any issues or questions, please consult the documentation for your specific operating system or SSH client.
